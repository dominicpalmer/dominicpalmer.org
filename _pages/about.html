<h4 id="overview" class="article-header-start">Overview</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  Hi, I'm Dom. I'm a software engineer in the Post Trade Systems team at
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www.mavensecurities.com/">Maven Securities</a>, a leading market maker and
  proprietary trading firm.<br><br>

  Prior to Maven I worked as a software engineer and dev team lead at
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www1.appliedsystems.com/en-us/">Applied Systems</a>, and as a statistical
  analyst at an insurance company called First Central.<br><br>

  Here you can read about me, my background, and what I'm currently working on. You can also read articles I write for
  my <a class="article-text-link" href="/blog/">blog</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="personal-background">Background</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I started out writing C++ at university, with a subsequent period of writing Python for data science at First Central.
  I've long since settled on C# as the perfect balance between versatility, productivity and performance. Day to day at
  Maven I'm working with the .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Postgres for persistence.<br><br>

  Outside of work I also enjoy trying out new technologies. As an example this website is backed by
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the Liquid template language and SCSS.<br><br>

<h4 id="education">Education</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I completed my BSc in Mathematics from the University of Sussex in 2016, and my MSc in Applied Mathematics from Imperial
  College in 2018.<br><br>

  For my master's project I wrote a coarse-grained simulation of tumour growth in C++ that targeted Imperial's high
  performance computing clusters. Source can be found

<h4 id="interests">Interests</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I enjoy travelling, experiencing new cultures, and learning something new every day. I tend to be interested by world
  and economic history, wildlife, nature and science.<br><br>

  I also enjoy playing chess. Familiarity with the game brings admiration for top level play, but you don't need to be
  familiar to take interest in
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDi6s89ooak">legendary games</a> regardless.<br><br>
