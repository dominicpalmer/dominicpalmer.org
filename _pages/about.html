<p class="article-text">
  Hi, I'm Dom. I'm a software engineer in the Post Trade Systems team at
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www.mavensecurities.com/">Maven Securities</a>, a leading market maker and
  proprietary trading firm.<br><br>

  Prior to Maven I worked as a software engineer and development team lead at an insurance technology company called
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www1.appliedsystems.com/en-us/">Applied Systems</a>, and as a statistical
  analyst at an insurer called First Central.<br><br>

  Here you can read about me, my background, and what I'm currently working on. You can also read articles I write for
  my <a class="article-text-link" href="/blog/">blog</a>.

<h4 id="personal-background">Background</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I started programming in 2014 at the University of Sussex, whilst mid-way through my undergraduate degree in Maths.
  I had enrolled on two numerical analysis courses, both of which taught computer science principles through MATLAB,
  plus the application of those principles in solving traditional computation problems. Examples include the
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization">discretisation of differential equations</a>,
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration">numerical quadrature</a>,
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolation</a>, and
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue_algorithm">eigenvalue problems</a>.<br><br>

  After graduating from Sussex I completed a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College London.
  The master's course covered application of mathematical theory in the context of computer science, and here I picked
  up C and C++ for my master's project. I wrote a coarse-grained simulation of tumour growth in C++ that targeted
  Imperial's high performance computing clusters. Source code is available on my
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://github.com/dominicpalmer/spatial-tangled-nature">GitHub</a>.<br><br>

  I later moved to Python for data science and machine learning at First Central, then backend software engineering in
  C# for financial services. During my time at Applied Systems I worked with C#, SQL Server, and JavaScript. At Maven
  Securities I predominantly work with .NET 6/7/8, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Postgres, although I also build applications
  using TypeScript, MongoDB and other technologies when suitable.<br><br>

  Outside of work I enjoy trying out new technologies. As an example, this website is backed by
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the Liquid template language and SCSS.<br><br>

<h4 id="education">Education</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I was awarded a BSc in Mathematics (First Class Honours) from the University of Sussex in 2016, with full
  scholarship granted for continued masters study. I was also presented with the
  'Prize for Excellent Mathematics BSc Performance' for graduating top of class.<br><br>

  I was awarded an MSc in Applied Mathematics (Distinction) from Imperial College London in 2018.<br><br>

  I completed the famed
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50</a>
  course offered by Harvard University during my time at Imperial. The verified certificate can be viewed

<h4 id="interests">Interests</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I enjoy travelling, experiencing new cultures, and learning something new every day. I tend to be interested by world
  and economic history, wildlife, nature and science.<br><br>

  I also enjoy playing chess. Familiarity with the game brings admiration for top level play, but you don't need to be
  familiar to take interest in
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDi6s89ooak">great games</a> regardless.<br><br>
