  Hi, I'm Dom. I'm a software engineer based in the United Kingdom.<br><br>

  Here you can read about me, my background, and what I'm currently working on. This site is also home to articles I write
  for my <a class="article-text-link" href="/blog/">blog</a>.<br><br>

  For a formal take on my background to date, have a look at my <a class="article-text-link" href="/cv/">CV</a>.

<h4 id="professional-background">Professional Background</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I'm a software engineer at <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www1.appliedsystems.com/en-us/">Applied Systems</a>,
  who are the market leaders in cloud based insurance management software. For a jargon-free example of what that means,
  I'm currently leading development of a set of .NET 6.0 microservices that calculate insurance premiums in real time
  according to pricing models specified by insurers.<br><br>

  At Applied I work with C#, .NET 6.0 and SQL Server on the backend, and sometimes work on web applications using ASP.NET
  Core, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I've also made use of Golang and PowerShell to write CLI tools.<br><br>

  Prior to Applied Systems I worked as a statistical analyst at an insurance company called First Central. My role there
  aligned closer with that of a data or research scientist, where freedom was given for teams to work in a research and
  development driven environment. The end goal was insurance pricing optimisation using machine learning techniques. Think

  and other statistical methods, used to extract signal from streams of noisy data. Tech used was mainly the Python data
  science stack (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, etc), SAS and SQL.

<h4 id="personal-background">Personal Background</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  Outside of work I enjoy learning about and dabbling in different technologies. This site as an example is backed by
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the Liquid template language and SCSS. Other
  personal projects involved use of C++, Python, and TypeScript.<br><br>

  I'm currently planning to revisit development of a chess engine I started working on in 2020. It's written in C++ and exposes a
  CLI compatible with the
  <a class="article-text-link" href="http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html">Universal Chess Interface</a>,
  meaning that once ready it will be able to compete with other open source engines on the
  <a class="article-text-link" href="http://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/404/">Computer Chess Rating List</a>.<br><br>

  I'm an advocate for open source, and incorporate the UNIX philosophy in my approach to software development. From system
  design down to optimising my local development environment, I'm driven by modularity, testability, and reduction of
  complexity. I favour best practices, clean code and clean architecture.

<h4 id="education">Education</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I completed my BSc in Mathematics from the University of Sussex in 2016, and my MSc in Applied Mathematics from Imperial
  College in 2018.<br><br>

  For my master's project I wrote a coarse-grained simulation of tumour growth in C++ that targeted Imperial's high
  performance computing clusters. Source code for the project can be found

<p class="article-text">
  I enjoy travelling, experiencing new cultures, and learning something new every day. I tend to be interested by world
  and economic history, wildlife, nature and science.<br><br>

  I also enjoy playing chess. Familiarity with the game brings admiration for top level play, but you don't need to be
  familiar to appreciate
