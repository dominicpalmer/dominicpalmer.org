  Hi, I'm Dom. I'm a software engineer based in the United Kingdom. Welcome to my personal site.<br><br>

  While the sidebar gives an overview of who I am and what I do, on this page you'll find a wider overview of my
  background and what I'm currently working on. This site is also home to articles I write for my
  <a class="article-text-link" href="/blog/">blog</a>.<br><br>

  For a more formal take on my professional background to date, have a look at my <a class="article-text-link" href="/cv/">CV</a>.

<h4 id="professional-background">Professional Background :office:</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I'm currently based in Brighton, but I've spent time living in London too. I'm a software engineer working remotely
  for the Belfast office of
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www1.appliedsystems.com/en-us/">Applied Systems</a>, who are the market
  leaders for cloud based insurance management software. For a jargon-free example of what that actually means, the
  main project I work on is a set of .NET Core microservices that calculate insurance premiums in real time according
  to pricing models specified by insurers.<br><br>

  At Applied I predominantly work with C#, .NET Core and SQL Server on the backend, although I also work on internal web
  tooling using ASP.NET Core, JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and have previously made brief use of Golang and PowerShell to write
  internal CLI tools. So the day to day can vary.
  <br><br>

  Prior to Applied Systems I worked as a statistical analyst at a UK-based motor insurance company called First Central.
  My role there aligned closer with that of a data or research scientist, where freedom was given for teams to work in a
  research and development driven environment. The end goal was insurance pricing optimisation using machine learning
  techniques. Think along the lines of

  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html">
    gradient boosting
  </a>
  and other statistical methods, all used to extract signal from streams of noisy data. Tech used was mainly the Python
  data science stack (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, etc.), SAS and SQL.

<h4 id="personal-background">Personal Background :sunrise:</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  Outside of work I'm a fan of the UNIX philosophy and favour FOSS tooling. My favourite Linux distribution is Kubuntu,
  my editors of choice are VSCode
  (<a class="article-text-link" href="https://github.com/dominicpalmer/dotfiles/blob/master/vscode/settings.json">with Vim keybindings</a>)
  and Neovim, I run either Windows Terminal or Zsh inside Tmux inside Alacritty, and I'm always on the lookout for interesting
  hardware and software that keeps my setup minimal and functional.<br><br>

  I enjoy learning about and dabbling in different technologies. This site as an example is backed by
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the Liquid template language and SCSS. Smaller
  personal projects I've worked on have used C++, Python, and TypeScript.<br><br>

  I'm currently planning to revisit development of a chess engine I started working on in 2020. It's written in C++ and exposes a
  CLI compatible with the
  <a class="article-text-link" href="http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html">Universal Chess Interface</a>,
  meaning that once ready it will be able to compete with other open source engines on the

<h4 id="education">Education :scroll:</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I completed my BSc in Mathematics from the University of Sussex in 2016, and my MSc in Applied Mathematics from Imperial
  College in 2018.<br><br>

  For my master's project I wrote a coarse-grained simulation of tumour growth in C++ that targeted Imperial's high
  performance computing clusters. Source code for the project can be found
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://github.com/dominicpalmer/spatial-tangled-nature">here</a>.

<h4 id="interests">Interests :musical_keyboard:</h4>
<p class="article-text">
  I love travelling and experiencing new cultures, although admittedly that's hardly a revelation and most certainly a clich√© -
  who doesn't enjoy going on holiday? Regardless, here's me looking somewhat intrepid, resting outside a Vietnamese village having
  just cycled a route through the
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/mekong-delta">Mekong Delta</a>, circa 2018.
  <br><br>

  <img class="article-text-image" src="/assets/images/vietnam.jpg" alt="vietnam"><br><br>

  I also enjoy playing chess. Familiarity with the game brings admiration for top level play, but you don't need to be
  a grandmaster to appreciate
  <a class="article-text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDi6s89ooak">impressive games</a>
  regardless. Alongside chess, I'm keen on music and make a point to pick up my guitar whenever I get the chance.
  <br><br>

  On a more general front, I tend to find myself taking interest in gaining adhoc skills that pay in the long term. I
  recently spent some time trialing out new keyboard layouts, reaching various levels of proficiency in Dvorak, Colemak,
  Colemak Mod-DH and Carpalx-QGMLWY, only to return to QWERTY touch typing for a better Vim experience.
  <br><br><br>
